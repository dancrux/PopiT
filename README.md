# PopiT
PopiT software provides a platform for Wine lovers to shop digitally from the comfort of their homes and have it delivered to them. 
The concept of the app is inspired by the imperative need for E-commerce shops. It seeks to create a platform for shoppers to be
educated about the varieties of wine, history, and wine production processes. Users can register, make orders, and track their
product delivery. It also presents an opportunity for users to browse through a variety of wine products and their rich documentary, 
Users also get to earn free drinks and gifts as they invite their friends to shop on the app.
